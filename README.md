## Sorting-Algorithms-Comparation

ðŸ’» The project was developed in Java using POO in NetBeans IDE 8.2. The objective is to compare the complexity of two sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort and Merge Sort) having
into account their run times, the number of instructions, and the complexity of these instructions. The algorithms were implemented recursive and non-recursive.
